# Devfolio gatsby-starter-landing

Kickstart landing page development with GatsbyJS

[Live Demo](http://devfolio-gatsby-starter.surge.sh)

## Installation

Install the dependencies:

### `yarn install`

Run the development server:

### `yarn dev`

Production build to `/public`:

### `yarn build`

Cleanup cache (often fixes misc errors when run before `yarn dev`):

### `yarn clean`

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/devfolioco/devfolio-gatsby-starter.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream,"
> Then fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`.
> Then you can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master`
> branch. Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular
> `git pull`.

## Content

Each of the sections in the site are placed in `src/sections`. Data is usually separated out into objects/arrays to be rendered by the component.

## SEO

The component `src/components/common/SEO.js` handles all meta data and SEO content, modify the `SEO_DATA` variable to add the data automatically. For application manifest data and favicon, modify the `gatsby-plugin-manifest` configuration in `gatsby-config.js`.
